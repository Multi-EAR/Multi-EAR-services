      --help, -h     Print help.
      --version, -v  Print version.

    multi-ear-services.sh only works on a Raspberry Pi platform.
    Environment variables $MULTI_EAR_ID and $MULTI_EAR_UUID should be defined in ~/.bashrc.

Usage
=====

Multi-EAR services are installed in a Python3 virtual environment ``(py37)``.

Activate the Python3 virtual environment

.. code-block:: console

    source ~/.py37/bin/activate


Services
========

- ``multi-ear-ctrl`` : local web service to access and monitor the device and data
- ``multi-ear-uart`` : sensorboard serial readout with local data storage and broadcast via websockets
- ``multi-ear-wifi`` : automatically generates a Wi-Fi hotspot when no known SSID is in range

Multi-EAR services are controlled and monitored via systemd_ system services.

.. _systemd: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd#Using_units

Check the status of a service

.. code-block:: console

    systemctl status multi-ear-uart.service

Log files are generated per services in ``/var/log/multi-ear/`` and can be filtered in ``journalctl``.
Check the ``multi-ear-uart`` system logs

.. code-block:: console

    journalctl -u multi-ear-uart.service --since yesterday --until now
